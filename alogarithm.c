// An alogarithm is a set of well defined sequence of instructions to solve a problem
//in simple words , it is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem
//an alogarithm shuld alwys have start and stop points
//alogarith for tea preparation
         inputs
//step1:take ingredients- milk,tea powder,water,sugar,bowl,stove,cups 
         code(instructions)
//step2:pour some water in a bowl and add tea powder to it
//step3:light up the stove with the bowl on it
//step4:add some milk and sugar
          output
//step5:serve in the cups

//defines  the logical order of the operation
//an algorithm shuldnot consist of code
//to write algorithm you first must know how to solve the problem
//the number of steps instuctions must be finite
//addition of two nos
//step1:start
//step2:declare 3 variables n1,n2 and sum
//step3:accept values for n1 and n2
//step4:add n1 and n2 and assign the result to sum
//step5:display the sum
//step6:stop
